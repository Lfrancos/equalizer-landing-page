### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This has been an interesting exercise, thanks to @grace-snow I was able to take a look at the way I was creating my css, I was getting used to a way that is not the best because I was selecting every single thing instead of taking advantage of making it a little bit more global.
Also I'm not sure if what I did was good or not but I started to use max-width making it easier to keep the design that was intended. This way when people changes the width of the page they won't get unwanted design. Up until this moment of my learning I feel like this could be a really interesting solution for responsive sites.

### Continued development

Want to make sure that the way I'm using "scss" is the most optimized way to do it. I know there are a lot of things that I'm not doing in the right way and the way that I'm using it is the most basic, I need to start adding a little bit mor complexity and seeing how it could help me make it better.

### Useful resources

For this exercise I did not use any resources, witch makes me proud in a way since I was able to create this with out any help : )

I really want to thank [@grace-snow](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/grace-snow) because her feedback has made me conscious of the way I'm approaching my "scss" and I'm sure that it is going to help me in the future.
